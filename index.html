      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2018 with a BS in Music Technology, where I primarily focused on building custom musical interfaces for both performance and interactive installations. I currently work as an audio technician at the McDonald Theatre and Cuthbert Amphitheatre in Eugene, OR, where my main responsibilities are to set up sound and power on the stages, create monitor mixes for musical acts, and interface with different tour crew members and artists. In addition to the work I do at the venues in Eugene, I also co-run an art collective, focused on large-scale interactive art, where I am the lead of the tech, sound, and interactivity department. I am always interested in learning new technologies and applying that knowledge in creative and unusual ways. </p>
